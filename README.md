---

## Evaluation Benchmarks

Tasks and benchmark datasets that are used to test LLMs in legal reasoning and language:  
- LawBench: Legal knowledge benchmark suite  
- Lexical/legal language tests for case retrieval, summarization, constitutional text comprehension, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
